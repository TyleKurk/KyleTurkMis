#This is a repository containing 7 concepts I have learned over the semester in MIS 310. 

#NestedLoop contains code tracking the users daily steps over a user defined number of weeeks, It prompts for a step input for each day of the week, calculatees the total number of steps taking, and computes the average steps per day. Results are then displayed. 

#Rainfall calculates the average monthly rainfall over a user specified number of years. Using more nested loops, it prompts the user to enter the rainfall data for each month in each year, then computes the total as well as the average amount of rainfall for all months tracked. 

#Random utilizes the random library
